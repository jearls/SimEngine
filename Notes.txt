Basic Simulation Engine usage
  Create the Simulation Engine
  Create the Workers, add to engine
  Start the engine

Each Worker:
  Depending on the Simulation Engine, code appropriate methods to do the
  simulation work.  The work method (any work method, if multiple are
  called) should return `true` unless the Worker should immediatley be
  removed from the simulation.

The Simulation Engine includes an engine-specific Clock.  The Clock can
  keep track of timing statistics, impose FPS restrictions, etc.

Simulation Engine Implementation Notes

The Simulation Engine creates a number of Task threads, independent of
the simulation Workers.

The Simulation Engine maintains three queues of Workers: `in`, `out`,
and `new`.
* `in` holds the Workers that will be processed during a simulation
  Frame.
* `out` holds the Workers that asked to continue to run for the next
  simulation Frame.
* `new` holds the Workers that were created during a simulation Frame.

When the Simulator Engine starts up, it initializes the clock, then
starts looping running simulation frames.

Before each frame begins, the Simulation Engine pulls all Workers out of
the `new` queue, initializes them, and adds them to the `in` queue.

It then starts the frame by synchronizing with the Task threads.

When a frame begins, each Task thread begins pulling Workers out of the
`in` queue and running them through the appropriate number of phases.

The Tasks synchronize with each other to ensure that all Workers finish
one phase before going to the next.  When no Workers need to do any more
work, the Tasks synchronize back with the Simulator Engine to end the
frame.  At this point, any Workers who should continue in the simulation
are in the `out` queue.

After the end of the frame, the Simulation Engine swaps the `out` and
`in` queues and runs the Clock.

If the `in` queue is not empty and neither the Clock nor an external
source stopped the simulation, the Simulation Engine loops back to start
a new frame (including the `Before each frame begins` processing). 

If any of those conditions is not true, then the Simulation Engine stops
the simulation.  It tells the Clock and all Workers to finish, terminates
the Task threads, and empties out all queues.
